# ServerlessApp
This is a serverless app project I built using the materials I got from a aws course from https://learn.cantrill.io/.
I built this out before taking my aws solutions architect certification so I could get hands on experience.
I did run into one issue along the way - wrong order of files in s3 bucket. My root folder was not in the highest level of hierarcy causing issues on my state website.
